# Databricks_hackathon_customer_feedback_analyzer
This is a customer feedback analyzer that my team and I made as part of Databricks Hackathon. 

This is a DBC file. You can import it to your databricks workspace and you will be able to see the project we completed.
I will be making this same project outside of databricks as well, which will make it better for everyone to understand and easier to look at. Stay tuned.
